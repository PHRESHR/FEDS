Personal FrontEnd Design Starter for building web apps, utilizing Angular, Gulp, Browserify, SASS, BEM and Flexbox. 
Borrowing from [Google Web Starter Kit (Beta)](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) and [angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate](github.com/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate) utilizing best [AngularJS practices](github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide).

### Getting Started

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/PHRESHR/FEDS.git myapp`
2. `cd myapp`
2. Run `npm install && bower install` from the directory
3. Run `gulp serve` (Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices)
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the application

Now that `gulp dev` is running, the server is up as well. Any changes will be automatically processed by Gulp and the server will be updated.
